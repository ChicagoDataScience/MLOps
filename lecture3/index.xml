      <description>TLDR Problem  Environmental compatibility is a headache, in addition to scaling, security, maintenance and upgrade of software and hardware.  For instance, in the serverless examples, the need for pickle5 instead of pickle was due to such incompatibility.  For hosted environments, we have to work hard on the devops to ensure the environments are the same. For serverless, we did this via the requirements file (Cloud Functions) and locally installing python packages (Lambda functions)  Solution  Containers</description>

      <description>We will first get learn a bit more about docker. From their website:
 Docker is an open platform (written in Go) for developing, shipping, and running applications.
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.</description>

      <title>Orchestration using ECS and ECR - Part I</title>

      <description>Intro  Orchestration means managing container life cycle from building them to deploying (which requires provisioning of appropriate compute resources, storage resources, networking resources), scaling, load-balancing and other tasks, while accounting for failures throughout.
 While there are many orchestration solutions, we will focus on a couple of them: ECS by AWS and Kubernetes (local hosted solution and managed by GCP). While there is Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) by AWS as well, we will omit it here, as the ideas are the same.</description>

      <description>Elastic Container Service (ECS)  This is a AWS propreitary solution for container orchestration. There are three key concepts to work with this solution:  Service: Manages containers and relates them to EC2 machines as needed Task: Is a specific container Cluster: Is the environment of EC2 machines where containers live  The below diagram illustrates these relationships.  Source: https://aws.com/ 
 We will set up a cluster and run a task/container and use a service to manage it.</description>

      <description>Deploy your image to Docker Hub container registry (needs an account, has free tier limits).
 Run a container using the python images from Docker Hub.
 Try to minimize the size of the docker images produced.
 Add checks for out of bound queries in your recommendation function (e.g., http://localhost/?uid=2000 will give a value error on the server and the browser will show that an internal server error occured).</description>
