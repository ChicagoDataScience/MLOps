      <description>A. TLDR  Models do not need to be complex, but it can be complex to deploy models. - Ben Weber (2020)
 Problem  We have to take care of provisioning and server maintenance while deploying our models. We have to worry about scale: would 1 server be enough? How to minimize the time to deploy (at an acceptable increase in cost)? How can a single developer or data science/analytics professional manage a complex service?</description>

      <title>Cloud Functions</title>

      <description>Intro  Cloud Functions (CFs) are a solution from GCP for serverless deployments. Very little boilerplate beyond what we will write for simple offline model inference. In any such deployment, we need to be concerned about:  where the model is stored (recall pickle and mlflow), and what python packages are available.   Empty Deployment  We will set up triggers that will trigger our serving function (in particular, a HTTP request).</description>

      <description>We modify the flask app that we had before, by again specifying the requirements.txt and the main python file appropriately. We will also increase the memory to 2GB and the timeout to 180 seconds. You will see that the following deployment has a lot of inefficiencies (can you spot the redundacy in loading the model and the predictions below?).
The requirements file will have the following entries:
numpy flask pandas google-cloud-storage scikit-surprise pickle5  The main file is also modified accordingly.</description>
