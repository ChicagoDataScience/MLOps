      <description>Online Learning Details To maximize the learning experience, it will be good if students can meet the following basic technology requirements:
 At a minimum, students should have a device and an internet connection. A microphone, and a webcam would be highly recommended. See the Basic Technology Requirements link for more details.
 Laptop, Chromebook or Desktop Computer: Note that Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself.</description>

      <description>Aim  The aim of the project is to simulate the real-world process of deploying machine learning models. More specifically, the project component of this course allows you to explore a technology that assists in model deployment, either directly or indirectly, and asks you to report your experience working with that technology (or multiple technologies) to achieve some overall deployment goal.  Group  You should form groups of 4 students for this project component (this is a strict requirement).</description>
