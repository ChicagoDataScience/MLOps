	"content": " Operationalizing Machine Learning (IDS594) This practice-oriented course surveys modern best practices around getting machine learning (ML) models into production. It continues where IDS 572 and IDS 575 left off: operationalizing machine learning workflows in the context of the larger business end-goals. The course is complementary to IDS 561. We will focus on: (a) ML monitoring, (b) orchestration, \u0026copy; governance, (d) continuous integration/deployment and (e) business impact. A preliminary list of topics that will be covered are:\n Containers for machine learning, the docker ecosystem, Kubernetes Git, CI/CD and their modifications for ML workflows A/B Testing of KPI improvements in Production Experiment tracking and logging Case studies of solutions such as Uberâ€™s Michelangelo, Facebook\u0026rsquo;s FBLearner Flow, Google\u0026rsquo;s TFX/Kubeflow and Databricks\u0026rsquo; MLFlow.  Prior programming experience: Python\nAdditional list of topics is being worked on.\n Course logistics are TBD.\n Work in progress. Class starts in Fall 2020.\n "
