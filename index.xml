      <description>Online Learning Details To maximize the learning experience, it will be good if students can meet the following basic technology requirements:
 At a minimum, students should have a device and an internet connection. A microphone, and a webcam would be highly recommended. See the Basic Technology Requirements link for more details.
 Laptop, Chromebook or Desktop Computer: Note that Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself.</description>

      <description>Aim  The aim of the project is to simulate the real-world process of deploying machine learning models. More specifically, the project component of this course allows you to explore a technology that assists in model deployment, either directly or indirectly, and asks you to report your experience working with that technology (or multiple technologies) to achieve some overall deployment goal.  Group  You should form groups of 4 students for this project component (this is a strict requirement).</description>

      <description>Python  We will be predominantly concerned with the Python ecosystem A big advanage is that local system development can be easily moved to cloud and or a scalable on-prem solution. Many companies use python to start data science projects in-house (via fresh recruits, interns etc) Python has some relatively easy ways to access databases Big data platforms such as Spark have great python bindings  E.g., Pandas dataframe and Spark dataframe  Latest models (deep learning, pre-trained) are built in the python ecosystem Many many useful libraries: pandas, matplotlib, flask,&amp;hellip;  Our Objective  Learn the patterns, not the specific tools  Deployment Targets  Local machines On-prem or self-hosted machines (needs DevOps skills) Managed cloud  Heroku (PAAS) Azure GCP AWS (IAAS)  The decision to deply on one versus the other depends on  skills business need internal vs external scale, reliability, security costs ease of deployment   Local Deployments are Hard  Need to learn linux security Need to learn how to manage access Need for learn backups Need to learn hot switching / reliability  Cloud Deployments are not Easy  Also need to learn a complex ecosystem Vendor lock-in (for successful businesses, this is not an issue)  Aside: Software Tools Python development can happen:</description>

      <description>It is important to secure your connection to the machine. In order to do so, we will configure the ssh access pattern as well as set up a firewall that blocks all incoming requests except ssh port and web server ports.
We will assume that we have a non-root account that is in the sudoers group.
SSH  When you first create the server instance, you may or may not have the ssh server running.</description>

      <description>Here are a few notes on installing a user specific python distribution:
Get Miniconda wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh conda install pip #better to use the pip in the base conda env than system pip   The difference between conda and pip: pip is a package manager specifically for python, whereas conda is a package manager for multiple languages as well as is an environment manager. Python module venv is python specific environment manager.</description>

Starting jupyter on the server can be done inside a screen session:
screen -S jupyter-session #can also use nohup or tmux here jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888  SSH tunnel can be setup by running the following on your local machine, and then opening the browser (http://localhost:8889)</description>

Using web requests (e.g., using a JSON payload)  How to output predictions?  We will plan to set up a server to serve predictions  It will respond to web requests (GET, POST) We pass some inputs (image, text, vector of numbers), and get some outputs (just like a function) The environment from which we pass inputs may be very different from the environment where the prediction happens (e.</description>

      <description>A. TLDR  Models do not need to be complex, but it can be complex to deploy models. - Ben Weber (2020)
 Problem  We have to take care of provisioning and server maintenance while deploying our models. We have to worry about scale: would 1 server be enough? How to minimize the time to deploy (at an acceptable increase in cost)? How can a single developer or data science/analytics professional manage a complex service?</description>

      <description>Intro  Cloud Functions (CFs) are a solution from GCP for serverless deployments. Very little boilerplate beyond what we will write for simple offline model inference. In any such deployment, we need to be concerned about:  where the model is stored (recall pickle and mlflow), and what python packages are available.   Empty Deployment  We will set up triggers that will trigger our serving function (in particular, a HTTP request).</description>

      <description>We modify the flask app that we had before, by again specifying the requirements.txt and the main python file appropriately. We will also increase the memory to 2GB and the timeout to 180 seconds. You will see that the following deployment has a lot of inefficiencies (can you spot the redundacy in loading the model and the predictions below?).
The requirements file will have the following entries:
numpy flask pandas google-cloud-storage scikit-surprise pickle5  The main file is also modified accordingly.</description>

      <description>TLDR Problem  Environmental compatibility is a headache, in addition to scaling, security, maintenance and upgrade of software and hardware.  For instance, in the serverless examples, the need for pickle5 instead of pickle was due to such incompatibility.  For hosted environments, we have to work hard on the devops to ensure the environments are the same. For serverless, we did this via the requirements file (Cloud Functions) and locally installing python packages (Lambda functions)  Solution  Containers</description>

      <description>We will first get learn a bit more about docker. From their website:
 Docker is an open platform (written in Go) for developing, shipping, and running applications.
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.</description>

      <description>Intro  Orchestration means managing container life cycle from building them to deploying (which requires provisioning of appropriate compute resources, storage resources, networking resources), scaling, load-balancing and other tasks, while accounting for failures throughout.
 While there are many orchestration solutions, we will focus on a couple of them: ECS by AWS and Kubernetes (local hosted solution and managed by GCP). While there is Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) by AWS as well, we will omit it here, as the ideas are the same.</description>

      <description>Elastic Container Service (ECS)  This is a AWS propreitary solution for container orchestration. There are three key concepts to work with this solution:  Service: Manages containers and relates them to EC2 machines as needed Task: Is a specific container Cluster: Is the environment of EC2 machines where containers live  The below diagram illustrates these relationships.  Source: https://aws.com/ 
 We will set up a cluster and run a task/container and use a service to manage it.</description>

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) a managed service for running Kubernetes, with key features such as security, scaling and multi-cluster support.
